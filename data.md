I have checked the dataset. Because I don't have the background knowledge of this relevant application domain, I have a lot of questions about the dataset which are list below. I'm sorry to bother you this time.

So the OCC_injection_data is the injection data  I should focus on which you mentioned in Project Introduction, is it right? Does this mean I don't need to use the data in ProductionData instead? Of course, I would appreciate it if you could tell me in more detail what the data in this folder are because there are too mant files in ProductionData(If I need use these data).

In the Well Data, there are two files, Well Workbook_Header and Well Workbook_Location. Both miss the header information. I can infer that Well Workbook_Location is the information about wells' locations. But I am a little confused about Well Workbook_Header, due to lack in header information, I can not infer that what data this is.

You also add a director called HydraulicFracturingData, do I need to use this data? Does the hydraulic fracturing data related to injection data?

Thanks!
